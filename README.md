# Stornoway

A mock-up project of Stornoway, a construction company website template powered by Zyro.com

## General Info

This is a training project where I replicated the Stornoway site template to grind my web development mastery. The site itself is simple, clean, and straightforward, so I heavily executed it using HTML and CSS.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6
- Basscss
